/*
 * -----Network-----
 * It is defined as collection of interconnected computers 
 * or devices
 * 
 * Network consisits of various network devices which will help in the 
 * smooth functioning of the network
 * eg:routers,switches,hubs etc;
 * 
 * 
 * various types of networks:
 * 			PAN personal area network
 * 			LAN local area network
 * 			MAN metero-politan area network
 * 			WAN wide area network
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * BASIC ARCHITECTURE IN NETWORK:
 * 
 * One-tier architecture
 * Two-tier architecture
 * three-tier architecture
 * 
 * different network topologies:
 * Bus
 * star
 * mesh 
 * ring
 * tree
 * hybrid
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * One-Tier architecture
 * 		--both client and server present in single system
 * Two-Tier architecture
 * 		-- two client having one server 
 * 		-- two clients are connected to one server
 * 
 * N-tier architecture
 * 		-- here multiple clients are there --
 *      -- intermediately one storage is there that is Internet--
 *      -- client can send to internet then to server its like intermediator or mediator
 *      
 * Personal area network:
 *  connected through multiple devices-- d-1 d-2 d-3 d-4 d-5
 *  it is a network which is built within a personal space
 *  it contains very minimal systems like 4-6 systems
 *  its coverage space is less than 5 kms range
 *  it is most flexible for an indivual operations
 *  it is not secured
 *  
 *  
 *  Local area network:
 *  many multiple devices are interconnected
 *  it is a network which is built within a particular locality range
 *  it contains numerours like 100-200 systems
 *  it coverage space is aroung 100kms in range
 *  it is most flexible for an  organizational purpose
 *  it is secured
 *  College system inter connection 
 *  
 * Meteropolitan area network
 * 
 * connected multiple number of local area network;
 * It is a network which is built within a 
 * city limit it contains multiple local area networks
 * its coverage space -- 300 kms in range
 * most flexible for organization purpose where we need to connect systems from
 * different localities of a city
 * it is secured
 * ,Eg MNC company network
 * 
 * 
 * Wide area network
 * connect multiple number of metropolitan area network
 * it is a network which is built for  wide range of connectivity
 * it contains multiple man 
 * its coverage space is large set of Kms
 * it is most flexible for an organizational purpose where
 * we need to connect systems from different states or cities
 * it is secured
 * Eg: MNC company network
 *
